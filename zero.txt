Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well.
I'm Sarah Johnson and I've been looking at your listing for the
2019 Toyota Camry.
I'm very interested in the car and would love to learn more about it.

Would it be possible to view the car on
September 30th at 11:00 AM?

Also, I'd like to propose a price of
$18,000.

If this time doesn't work for you or if you have any other available times, please let me know as soon as possible.
